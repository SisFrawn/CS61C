in comments.s, comments are causing segmentation faults, otherwise it works correctly with all the comments taken out.

in imm.s, all works perfectly

in jumps.s, the 3rd label causes a segmentation fault.
	with it removed, the text segment works, but the symbol table is offset by +4, and the relocation
	table is empty

	FIXED: fix offset in symbol table

	FIXED: relocation table now adds stuff correctly

	FIXED: jumps.s now works perfectly

in labels.s, labels with empty followups are problematic,

	labels now working perfectly

pseudos now working perfectly

combined now working perfectly
